# Finance Portfolio

Hello, welcome to my repository containing a portfolio of finance and algorithmic trading projects completed by me for career, academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes. These projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks, and have been completed using Python 3.14 along with various libraries and tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and the QuantConnect Lean Engine.

I am always willing to meet new people in hopes of doing business together. I can be reached via email at drewrglov@gmail.com.
